User: Well the speed that the vaccine was produced; there are multiple vaccines some using mRNA and some that differ. So whilst most will probably have no side effects you can't be for certain. Especially since some of the vaccination are based on new methodologies. There has barely been enough testing on over 65s which has been criticised in a few recent academic papers. So I really don't see the benefit of taking it if I am young and healthy, it just doesn't seem worth the risk.

User: Yeah but surely herd immunity could occur through the vaccination of the most vunerable groups as I would be one of the last to be vaccinated. I am young and fit, so it is very unlikely Covid will have much impact. Also the government have been picking and selecting scientific advice and the vaccine doesn't stop you getting the virus either.

User: Well if I am vaccinated I could still transmit the virus... Therefore vaccinating the most in need should be all that is required if you want to use that logic. Also means less vaccines would be needed which would benefit from an economic stand point (deficit has got a lot bigger recently)

User: I mean you could shield the vunerable if you really wanted, which would stop the virus spreading to those at risk and allow the economy to run. This would also mean herd immunity and you could concentrate the vaccine to those who are most are risk. I don't see how me having the vaccine will help further when I would be one of the last group. So herd immunity would already be round then if the vaccine works, so it would be pointless to take it. Furthermore, the virus mutates and therefore the vaccine won't work effectively until other vaccines come from the likes of GSK, which will take several months. You are not looking at it from an economic stand point where support ratios are all time lows and is not sustainable. At some point you just need to get on with normal life otherwise the majority will be worse off.

User: My health is fine though and I've got family/friends who have had it, therefore they would have the anti-bodies to fight it again if need be. The majority of people are not impacted by the virus. In fact it is those who are overweight or have self-inflicted illnesses that has caused more stress on the NHS and worsened the numbers. We are the fattest country in Europe and they close the gyms (low transmission rate), it honestly doesn't make sense.

User: I'm not tooo concerned about it. I've taken the proper precautions in keeping quarantined. I don't have anyone close to me that has contracted it and others have been in minor contact with those that have.

User: I honestly have been psychologically, dare I say happier, since we are not going back to normal. As an African American from a less desirable urban neighborhood the "normal" way was rough. It is only now that I can afford to do things and Black lives are at the forefront of political debate. None of things would have happened during the "Old Way." As far as people being sick, of course my heart goes out to those people. We are a nation that has to stick together and the overall vaccination is a definite help to our national community.

User: I didn't worry about them much. Most of my family lives in Detroit, MI. Detroit was hard hit with Corona and I have family who work in the hospitals. Yet they take better precautions then I do because they ae mandated to be tested for covid-19. As far as I'm concerned there's no better place for them to be other than at home. In terms of my health, I feel better knowing that I don't have to socialize all the time and make excuses to speak to people in commercial settings.

User: I am young and healthy and also never get the flu vaccine
CB: young_1
User: but the same is true for the flu - I am sure if you are young and healthy the chances are less likely to get long covid
CB: young_2
User: the chances are still very low, so I don't think a vaccine is necessary
CB: default_1
User: that is very true
CB: default_2
User: also true, but I have to admit, I believe those that cannot get it or are at risk should be locked up and not the whole population
CB: default_3
User: I am not worried about it anyway
CB: short_term_1
User: huh?

User: The worldwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a rushed vaccine. Regularly, a vaccine can take up to 10 years to develop and release openly to the public for medical use. The rigorous testing involved in developing a vaccine is required to discover any negative effects that can arise. I do not want to take the vaccine because I am not aware of any potential long-term risks associated with it.

User: This is true, but once again, no one is sure of the long-term effects of this vaccine. The current studies being conducted and released only cover a small fraction of what can be possible.

User: Problems associated with COVID-19 are especially dangerous for people that are at risk with current health complications. If the majority of the population is able to endure the disease and recover with very minor complications that will be remedied, it is not a large risk. Future complications could arise from the vaccine related to more complex health issues than just COVID-19. I have had COVID-19 and was thankfully able to recover with almost no problems at all. It felt like a regular flu. I do not have any research to provide for the long-term effects of the vaccine as there is not enough data unfortunately. Ultimately, I see it as a serious risk to take the vaccine because of possible unknown variables.

User: Herd immunity can be achieved through the vaccine, this is correct. But there are other ways to avoid spreading the disease such as the current policies of staying indoors for quarantine, social distancing, and mask wearing that works to reduce the risk of spread. Once the vaccine is more researched in the future and the health risks are highlighted, I would consider taking the vaccine. For the time being, many people taking the vaccine are not aware of certain risks they are taking. They are looking for a short-term cure to a long-term problem.

User: I have very little information to contribute about past vaccines. I have not prepared for this argument unfortunately so I now forfeit.

User: That is false. Health should always be a top priority, especially after getting a vaccine that was a rushed as this one. Once again, the vaccine can have a different effect on different people. There have already been cases where individuals have died because of the vaccine, and a portion of those cases were not reported on in mass media to avoid panic and anxiety.

User: not really, since the virus can evolve and mutate so theoretically i could still get a strain of the virus even after taking the vaccine

CB: safety_1
User: i heard the vaccine works with mrna, meaning genetically modified deoxyribonuclaic acid, and as far as i know, the implications of mrna aren't fully understood

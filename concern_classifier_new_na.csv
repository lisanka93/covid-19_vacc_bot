concern,argument
long_term_effects,True. But what are the short term and long term side effects.? 
long_term_effects,You could be right. But what if the long term e
long_term_effects,You could be right. You do make sense but what if the long term effect turns out to be deadly 
long_term_effects,Vaccine long term affects 
long_term_effects,I don't think it has been around for long enough
long_term_effects,Once again it only got emergency approval....where are the long term affect data
long_term_effects,I'm not talking about temporary side effects Im talking about long lasting ones
long_term_effects,As I said Im not talking about short term side effects Im talking about long term ones
long_term_effects,I also dont think this vaccine has been around long enough to know if it's safe
long_term_effects,I'm worried about the potential long-term side effects.
long_term_effects,"The vaccine was rolled out very quickly in the grand scheme of things, so I don't believe scientists truly know what long-term effects could be."
long_term_effects,There hasn't been enough time to effectively test the vaccine and establish it's long-term effects on the human body. There have been a substantial amount of reported side effects which is very worrying. 
long_term_effects,"Vaccines take years to create, this was rushed and therefore, the data collected cannot state what the long term effects are."
long_term_effects,Because the effects of long term havent been proven
long_term_effects,"yes thats true on both cases, but why should i trust whatever the people making the vaccine to have the best interest in it for me in the long run when i personally dont know the materials used in the vaccine, so to me the effects of covid 19 could just be the effects of a flu and be done and over with, when the effects of a vaccine could be long term worse in 10 years or whatever like that. the vaccines i have taken before such as the flu vaccines; ended up making me more sick for a short time then the flu would of normally."
long_term_effects,"wont have to worry about it for now, though but how long is that really gunna last, could be tomorrow a new one that pops up and isnt just as easily treatable"
long_term_effects,"Because I believe that these vaccines have been rushed through development a little too hastily, and not enough time has been established to identify any long term side affects or other problems. Plus I have concerns about the 'no-liability' clause."
long_term_effects,It has not had the long term effects tested 
long_term_effects,The risks of long COVID are smaller than the risk from the vaccine
long_term_effects,"It's too soon, unknown side effects and unknown how long it's effective for"
long_term_effects,I’m worried about the long term side effects of which we cannot be certain of until some time has passed
long_term_effects,what about long term side effects?
long_term_effects,"However, the vaccine doesn't offer the protection for long enough for the herd community to fully develop on a long term basis"
long_term_effects,i do believe that but vaccines usually take years to develope to ensure their long term safety
long_term_effects,How can they know about long term side effects in years to come 
long_term_effects,Ive seen this explanation before of the long term effects but they never state the long term side effects caused by the vaccine in some people
long_term_effects, Hi who knows what the long term side effects are for example with child bearing woman later down the line 
long_term_effects,have you considered long term effects?
long_term_effects,Long term hasn't been tested 
long_term_effects,Concern about long term safety 
long_term_effects,Because I don’t know about the long term effects and I don’t want to sign my life away 
long_term_effects,I understand that but we do not know long term side effects. you cannot buy time
long_term_effects,It's new and hasn't been around long
long_term_effects,I would because of the potential long term effects of the vaccine
long_term_effects,Long term affects won’t be known for a long time. 
long_term_effects,That’s also a hypothetical argument. Despite the differences there could still be long term health implications that are currently unknown. 
long_term_effects,But we still don’t know how often everyone would need to be vaccinated abs how long immunity lasts. 
long_term_effects,What about the long term side effects?
long_term_effects,The long term effects were still not studied
long_term_effects,I would be worried about long term effects 
long_term_effects,Said it before it is not safe or known the long term effects
long_term_effects,I do not want to take a COVID-19 vaccine once one becomes available to me because this vaccine has not been tested for an extented period of time and we do not know the side effects that people will maybe get in a couple of years
long_term_effects,Because the vaccine might not last long
long_term_effects,Effects not known over a long period of time
long_term_effects,they developed it way too quickly and under duress so its difficult to trust the long term effects
long_term_effects,what if multiple years down the line the effects of the vaccine are worse than covid
long_term_effects,I think that it’ll cause side effects in the long term 
long_term_effects,So you agree with me that the long term effects are unknown. Please don’t try to persuade me otherwise 
long_term_effects,I worry about the unknown long term effects 
long_term_effects,It hasn’t been around long enough to know whether or not there are any long term symptoms 
long_term_effects,If you do not know about any long term effects then why release the vaccine? Is that not just creating a bigger risk for everyone who takes the vaccine?
long_term_effects,"The vaccine hasn’t been tested enough for anyone to say that I won’t have to worry about my health, it could have severe long term effects that have not yet been identified "
long_term_effects,Covid has been around for a while now so if there were any long term effects it would mainly be to do with the respiratory system as thats the area the virus attacks. 
long_term_effects,It could cause problems in years time
long_term_effects,I know but it’s not been tested for long
long_term_effects,i mean long term side effects
long_term_effects,"the vaccine was developed so fast, even with known ingredients long term side effects are possible"
long_term_effects,Because we don't know what effects it may have as not been out long enough.
long_term_effects,long term side effects thgough!!
long_term_effects,but you cannot test on long term side effects no matter how many stages are done simultaneously
long_term_effects,no we do not know the long term side effects 
long_term_effects,I worry the long term effects will be worse
long_term_effects,The vaccines have not been out long enough yet to see the long term effects.
long_term_effects,I agree with herd immunity but if the vaccine causes long term side effects and everyone gets vaccinated we will have a much serious problem on our hands.
long_term_effects,A long time ago doesn't matter. We know nothing about this slickness.
long_term_effects,Because we have no long term testing of the covid vaccine.
long_term_effects,The vaccine may not have long lasting coverage 
long_term_effects,yes i have heard this before but i am still not convinced - what if there are long term side effects that have not yet been discovered ? 
long_term_effects,Who knows what side effects short and long term the vaccine can bring to people. It may be even worst than Covid itself 
long_term_effects,Not enough research on the long term effects
long_term_effects,i'm waiting for research on the long term effects of the vaccine and the effectiveness between variants
long_term_effects,yea but for how long if we all suffer long term health problems from it
long_term_effects,but what about the long term ones?
long_term_effects, Ok so it might be safe for short term use but not long term use given how new it is
long_term_effects,"that sounds pretty shit. but a vaccine might cause ever-lasting instead of long lasting side effects, no?"
long_term_effects,The vaccine hasn’t been going for long enough to know the effects 
long_term_effects,There is no way of knowing the long-term side effects
long_term_effects,"This is true, but once again, no one is sure of the long-term effects of this vaccine. The current studies being conducted and released only cover a small fraction of what can be possible."
long_term_effects,that is not true! I would be super worried about long term consequences of the vaccine
long_term_effects,but the long term side effects of the vaccine might be worse than long covid
long_term_effects,you are talking about short term effects but what about long term effects of the vaccine and note that it is given to everyone regardless of age or medical background.
long_term_effects,long term effects of vaccine
long_term_effects,well you see just because we know the short-term side effects we don't know the long-term side effects
long_term_effects,just because we know the ingredients doesn't make it any less possible to have adverse long-term side effects
long_term_effects,The MRNA vaccine technology is new and there is relatively little information on the long-term effects.
long_term_effects,We have only known about covid for a year. We do not have enough experience or knowledge to be able to make any long-term claims.
long_term_effects,I would still worry because I do not know the long-term effects of the vaccine or if they will make me susceptible to some other issue.
long_term_effects,That is a statement of conjecture. There is no way to know if the long term side-effects are more likely than the long term side effects from the vaccine because not enough time has passed in order to make any long-term comparisons.
long_term_effects,mRNA is a new technology. There is no long history with this type of vaccine.
long_term_effects,"the vaccine wasn't tested long enough, what about long term side effects?"
long_term_effects,Long term risks 
long_term_effects,I would still be worried about potential long term effects
long_term_effects,what about the long term side effects?
long_term_effects,Some people have complained about side effects that last a long time
long_term_effects,How do you know there aren’t long term side effects
long_term_effects,"You say a very long time ago, Covid has only been around for a year ?"
long_term_effects,But not all Covid survivors have long terms effects do they
long_term_effects,But what about long term side effects
long_term_effects,"Nevertheless, long term effects are still an issue. We can't predict the future."
long_term_effects,"That's one of my worries - there is so much we don't know about the vaccine - efficacy, long-term side effects and how often the vaccine is needed."
long_term_effects,No one can say that the long term effects of the vaccine are less than COVID as it hasn't been tested enough.
long_term_effects,I will worry about potential long term effects!
long_term_effects,I have heard of long covid but dont know anyone who had it
long_term_effects,But we don't know anything about potential long term side effects
long_term_effects,and long term side effects that cant be observed now?
long_term_effects,you didnt answer my question but ok - I would still be worried about potential long term effects
long_term_effects,I'm more fearful of long-term side effects to be honest as these may have life altering consequences
long_term_effects,The percentage of people suffering from long covid is low though and I find your argument not particularly convincing 
long_term_effects,You are right but we still don’t know the long term side affects from this drug or even from covid
long_term_effects,I think it’s too early to speculate that long term effects are more likely from Covid than they are the vaccines. People thought for many years smoking was safe before realising it wasn’t 
long_term_effects,"I understand all that, but there is no way of knowing any long term side effects"
long_term_effects,It seems risky to have a vaccine which could lead to bigger problems down the line
long_term_effects,But we are still not sure about the long term effects
long_term_effects,Because it has not been researched long enough.
long_term_effects,"Still, the long therm effects are unknown"
long_term_effects,The effect of the vaccine for the long therm is unknown
long_term_effects,It hasn’t been around long enough to know it’s safe 
long_term_effects,Not sure about its long term side effects
long_term_effects,"ok fair enough, but what about long term side effects"
long_term_effects,I would rather wait and see whether there are any long term side effects from the vaccine
long_term_effects,Given I dont know the long term side effects I would stll worry
long_term_effects,I don't want to inject my body with a foreign vaccine where i do not know the long-term effect
long_term_effects,But there is no data on the long term side affects of using the vaccine
long_term_effects,they can not know what the long term side effects are as the testing was so short
long_term_effects,being able to go out with friends isn't worth the risk of long term health issues the vaccine may bring
long_term_effects,just going to wait until there is more information about the effects of the vaccine long term
long_term_effects,but no long term effects have been tested
long_term_effects,Long term side effects are not known or tested yet
long_term_effects,"Even if ingredients are known, they are not known in long term as no one has tested any of the covi-19 vaccines for more than 3 months"
long_term_effects,long term effects unknown
get_spread_covid,We hope so.how can u be so sure that this vaccine will stop us getting the virus again.? 
get_spread_covid,the COVID vaccine doesn’t stop you from catching COVID though 
get_spread_covid,I only get vaccinated when I need to travel abroad.
get_spread_covid,But it has already been said that if you have the vaccine you can still spread it 
get_spread_covid,"So you agree that mistakes can happen? It doesn't matter how long ago these mistakes happened, it is still a risk. "
get_spread_covid,"the way i see it is a 50/50 toss up youre stuck regardless of you getting the vaccine or not getting the vaccine the only surefire way to fully stop the spread is not be exposed, and how is that even possible when people dont even follow the rules as it is."
get_spread_covid,"The vaccine just reduces your chances, doesn't stop you getting it"
get_spread_covid,You can still get covid with the vaccine
get_spread_covid, I disagree as the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from catching or spreading Covid 
get_spread_covid,As it won’t make me immune to having covid
get_spread_covid,IT DOES NOT PREVENT ME FROM GETTING It 
get_spread_covid,It still doesn't protest you from getting corona virus. It just make it milder
get_spread_covid,Also you can’t choose which vaccine you get
get_spread_covid,The vaccine doesn’t stop anyone getting it
get_spread_covid,"I mean the vaccine is not guarantee to avoid covid, it’s just decreasing the rate of getting it"
get_spread_covid,i read that even with the vaccine you can still transmit covid and will likely need 3 jabs and still need to wear masks
get_spread_covid,"Yeah but surely herd immunity could occur through the vaccination of the most vunerable groups as I would be one of the last to be vaccinated. I am young and fit, so it is very unlikely Covid will have much impact. Also the government have been picking and selecting scientific advice and the vaccine doesn't stop you getting the virus either. "
get_spread_covid,i dont think enough people will vaccinate to protect those that cannot get the vaccine unless it becomes mandatory
get_spread_covid,You’ve just argued that you can still transmit it with the vaccine so I don’t believe it will protect us all if there are people unable to get it. 
get_spread_covid,but even with the vaccine you can still get covid cant you
get_spread_covid,The vaccine doesn’t make you immune
get_spread_covid,The vaccine doesn’t stop you spreading it
get_spread_covid,This is also false.  These vaccines do not prevent you from getting the virus.
get_spread_covid,you can still transmit the virus with the vacinne
get_spread_covid,But i think it is very unlikely anyway that i will get Covid.
get_spread_covid,"Well, I mean, the vaccine doesn't eradicate all illnesses"
get_spread_covid,"Yes, but herd immunity is only if noone can catch the virus, sadly tje vaccine doesn't give protection against the virus"
get_spread_covid,"As I said herd immunity exists only if we won't be able to catch the virus, the vaccine doesn't give protection against it"
get_spread_covid,"It doesn't stop people from catching the virus, though, so this is a misleading argument"
get_spread_covid,You cannot know that for sure as people who are currently getting the vaccine are among the first and are essentially guine-pigs
get_spread_covid,It is also a very htpothetical to suggest that i can get Covid19. 
get_spread_covid,I can still pass on COVID to someone else
get_spread_covid,"If it doesn’t stop me getting COVID, nor does it stop me spreading it. I don’t understand the benefit of having it. "
get_spread_covid,"This is about control, not her immunity as the virus can still be spread"
get_spread_covid,Id rather try to avoid catching covid and not getting vaccinated
get_spread_covid,Because it can be cured with Hydroxychloroquine
get_spread_covid,"I dont believe their is prove that this vaccine will stop the spread of the virus, so too much of contradictions "
get_spread_covid,COVID doesn’t bother me I’m not worried about my Heath 
get_spread_covid,My boyfriends grandpa received the covid vaccine and2
get_spread_covid,"But it has been shown that having the vaccine does not prevent you from becoming infected again, nor does it prevent you from infecting other people. So why have it? That is not a credible vaccine."
get_spread_covid,"yea you're probably right. at least I wont have to be paranoid about me or any of my family or friends catching it if we all get vaccinated, even if we wont achieve herd immunity"
get_spread_covid,But the vaccine doesn't make it 100% certain you won't get the virus
get_spread_covid,You can still get virus with vaccine
get_spread_covid,It has been spread to more than 80% of population. We have to develop immunity by ourselves because nothing can fully protect us anyway 
get_spread_covid,They can get ill with the other mutations.
get_spread_covid,The vaccine has not been proven to prevent covid or covid transmission. It has only been shown to reduce symptoms in those who are exposed.
get_spread_covid,but you will still be able to transmit the virus
get_spread_covid,Because it won't protect me from getting covid and it won't protect my relatives from getting it from me
get_spread_covid,But you won't get immunity after vaccine. You can still get covid. 
get_spread_covid,No it won't. You still can get covid after vaccine. 
get_spread_covid,I’ve read that even when you’ve had the vaccine you can still spread Covid you just don’t suffer the illness
get_spread_covid,I disagree as it’s still not been proven that vaccinated people can’t spread the disease
get_spread_covid,Because apparently you can still get covid after getting it
get_spread_covid,I think they are another methods to stop the spread of the virus
get_spread_covid,This drug will not stop us getting the virus it will only help in not getting it so bad
get_spread_covid,Because it does not 100% prevent me from catching covid
get_spread_covid,I am not getting the vaccine or anything bill Gates has anything to do with because he has gone on record as saying he wants to depopulate the human race and this vaccine hoax is a way the elites can do this
get_spread_covid,There are people vaccinated still get infected
get_spread_covid,"Current jabs don't stop people getting or transmitting the virus, but people are not getting that message. If they think they are immune, they will go back to normal life and the spread will make 2020 look like a stroll in the park."
get_spread_covid,It doesn't provide immunity.
get_spread_covid,"The current treatments are just that - treatments. They aren't vaccines, they don't provide immunity and they won't stop the spread. They will accellerate it."
get_spread_covid,"A packet of cough sweets doesn't stop people getting flu, it only helps with the symptoms. These so-called vaccines are no different."
get_spread_covid,might get covid from the vaccine
get_spread_covid,but you can still get and transmit covid I have read
get_spread_covid,No it doesnt stop us from getting covid
get_spread_covid,"I know however, they say you can still catch the virus even after getting the vaccine."
get_spread_covid,Getting ill 
get_spread_covid,Doesn’t stop you from getting the virus 
get_spread_covid,Not everyone will get it so here immunity can’t be created
get_spread_covid,How can you say that for certain? You can't guarantee that so you can't state that as a fact
get_spread_covid,"Again, you don't know that for certain. We have no proof to say you can't still transmit the virus"
get_spread_covid,But you can still catch the virus after having the vaccine
get_spread_covid,But you can still die from covid 19 after you have taken the vaccine
get_spread_covid,there are a percent of people who can not take vaccines anyway 
get_spread_covid,"but you can still get ill after a vaccine, people who get the mmr can still gets mumps for example"
get_spread_covid,but you can still catch it?
get_spread_covid,no because you can still catch it and get ill
get_spread_covid,people that get the vaccine can be a carrier without knowing and pass it on to someone that's not immune and then they can get ill and can cause death 
get_spread_covid,"you won't get the symptoms, you can still get the virus and pass it on not knowing "
death,the evidence shows that elderly people in care homes are dying 
death,yet they are dying in huge numbers after getting the vaccine
death,thats just certain peoples opinion
death,people die if they get the vaccine 
death,Are people dying and getting sick from the vaccine?
death,I hadn’t heard of people dying from it. 
death,but lots of people have died from having the vaccine or even caught covid shortly after the vaccine
death,Some people have been dieing from the vaccine.
death,Some people can die or get seriously ill for taking the vaccine 
death,There are some people who reported sideeffects already after taking it. There are some people who still died from Covid even after taking the vaccine 
death,I could die
death,Many People have died from the covid vaccine already!
death,They have died from the vaccine
death,people are dying from the vaccine 
death,more people have died after the vaccine was rolled out
death,"I don't even get flu vaccines, and people have been dying after taking the vaccine"
death,What if I die from the vaccine
death,some people have died from the vaccine
death,What if I die
death,i believe people should be allowed to choose for themselves
death,what if i die from the vaccene
death,I have considered that but I would rather more people take it first
death,my grandfather died from the vaccine
death,"Yeah, and I will be in the minoriry of unvaccinated people "
death,How can people die from it?
death,I disagree. There is evidence that people are dying after having the vaccine
death,some people that have allergies can die from the vaccine
fast_development,"i do not want the vaccine because it has been developed in a short amount of time, so i'm not sure if it is safe"
fast_development,It's been developed in a hurry
fast_development,The vaccine was made too quickly 
fast_development,Because I feel it’s been brought out too quickly
fast_development,"exactly, this vaccine was very short development"
fast_development,speed the vaccine was developed
fast_development,If it was made so quickly how do you know that it works
fast_development,I think everything has been to quick and I don't really believe in plying my body with chemical drugs
fast_development,You haven’t answered my argument
fast_development,Not confident in it. Took very little time to develop
fast_development,it was rushed
fast_development,Because vaccines take years to develop and test and this somehow is ready in less than a year
fast_development,most vaccines take years to make
fast_development,Feel it may have been rushed somewhat
fast_development,because it has been developed and rolled out so fast
fast_development,It’s been developed in a year. I don’t want to inject something without years of research backing up my safety
fast_development,it was rushed 
fast_development,"This vaccine was made very quickly though, could say it's been rushed"
fast_development,cos its fast
fast_development,It was rushed 
fast_development,Because the vaccine was made so quick. 
fast_development,There might not be enough vaccinations to be given to everyone and everyone may not be able to afford to have a vaccine
fast_development,because it has only being developed in the past year
fast_development,the mRNA has never passed animal-testing before because it ALWAYS killed all the animals. these tests were bypassed in the COVID-19 vacinne development
fast_development,but in the past vaccines were not developed as rushed
fast_development,"The the vaccine was rushed, how can we trust it"
fast_development,"I am not sure it is safe, it was made too quickly"
fast_development,it was developed too quickly
fast_development,i don't trust the vaccine as it was approved too quickly
fast_development,What if we are risking ourselves for short amusements 
fast_development,Its all being rushed 
fast_development,because it was created way too fast compared to any other vaccine
fast_development,How can a credible vaccine be developed in such a short space of time though? Doctors have speculated how it can be developed so quickly when vaccines normally take years to develop and monitor adverse side effects.
fast_development,It has been made too quickly and barely been tested 
fast_development,"because it was developed so fast, because of the misinformation everywhere, I just dont want to risk taking it"
fast_development,development was too rushed
fast_development,"usually, so what you're saying is they haven't been as vigorous in testing this vaccine as they should be and therefore i shouldn't get the vaccine."
fast_development,I am not against vaccines but this one seems a bit too rushed and I would rather wait a bit before I would consider getting it
fast_development,makes sense but given I am not in the risk group it will probably still take a while until I get it and more will be known by then
fast_development,because it takes years to test this kind of vaccine
fast_development,You have made an anti-vaccination argument to argue for the COVID-19 vaccine.
fast_development,the development has been super rushed
fast_development,maybe but I'd rather not inject something into my body that has been so fast developed
fast_development,but no vaccine has ever been developed to fast in the past either
fast_development,because the vaccine was produced too quickly
fast_development,But the vaccine was developed in less than a year!
fast_development,We haven't had enough time to test it
fast_development,It all happened so fast
fast_development,true but given how fast the vaccine was developed I am not sure what to think of it
fast_development,"That is another reason I don't want to, because of the expedited process to get the vaccine out as quick as possible and lack of proper testing. I don't trust it."
fast_development,Its still not safe. There are many repurcussions to taking a vaccine that was made so quickly
fast_development,That’s fine but I still don’t trust it and the speed it was produced in 
fast_development,This is not true. Drugs have been made fast before in the last 20years and law suits are out against the drug companies 
fast_development,What if the vaccine has been rushed 
fast_development,I’m not sure that it is. This vaccine has been passed too quickly. I don’t understand how they can find a vaccine so quickly for this but not other things like cancer  
fast_development,Science is wonderful but it isn’t always right. This programme has been rushed and I’m not convinced the vaccine is right for me despite being a frontline worker
fast_development,It seems too quick
fast_development,I fear safety had been compromised for speed
fast_development,The vaccine was made too quickly in my opinion
fast_development,The testing phase was short
fast_development,in the past vaccines were not developed that fast
fast_development,Other vaccines take longer to become available to the public this one is too quick 
fast_development,The vaccine is rushed too fast 
effectiveness,vaccine doesn’t work
effectiveness,The vaccine may not be effective for me
effectiveness,"I have, and my family and friend are free to make a decision that works best for them. Covid 19 is not a joke but neither is an 'unqualified' vaccine "
effectiveness,probably that's what will happen. Lot's of people will vaccine just because they need to travel for work
effectiveness,Uncertainty that it will work
effectiveness,Again no guarantee it will 100% work
effectiveness,"Because until I see clear cut evidence that this is working, I will not change my mind"
effectiveness,How do you know it works
effectiveness,doesnt work
effectiveness,The government themselves are unsure weather the vaccine will work
effectiveness,That doesnt affect me as i fully work from home and enjoy doing so
effectiveness,I don’t think the vaccine is working for everyone.
effectiveness,Yes but it may not be fully effective
effectiveness,not enough testing to prove it actually works
effectiveness,The covid 19 vaccine will change my DNA and will alter the way my body works that is why I do not want to take it
effectiveness,Why do i still need to wear a mask then after taking the vaccine if it really workd why would i neef to get revaccinated that means it doesnt work
effectiveness,is it effective
effectiveness,"Taking the vaccine, does not reduce the risk as it could be ineffective"
effectiveness,well that shows its not as effective as first thought 
effectiveness,how do you know how long the vaccine works for ?
effectiveness,which vaccine do we know is the most effective
effectiveness,but their is no evidence neither that it works
effectiveness,i wonder are these vaccine really working or not
effectiveness,i dont think there has been enough testing and i think as its not 100% effective the likelihood of catching covid 19 wont be reduced enough to be effective
effectiveness,How effective is the vaccination for young people
effectiveness,but we don't know how effective the vaccine is
effectiveness,i just dont believe it will work. and not everyone will get it
effectiveness,so the vaccine does not contain an active ingredient? I need to research how it works then
effectiveness,only if the vaccine works
effectiveness,the vaccine was tested by having 2 doses within a couple of weeks and the government have changed this with regard to if it is still effective
effectiveness,a hostory of covid should technically work in the sam eway as the vaccine if the dose is not active
effectiveness,"i must worry, the vaccine is a work in progress"
side_effects,There have been reports or people with negative reactions.
side_effects,But what if I experience an unexpected side effect
side_effects,because I'm afraid of the side affects
side_effects,"yes, that is if the true but if the sides affects are fatal, is it worth it?"
side_effects,that still doesnt tell me how its going to effect me 
side_effects,I am concerned about the side effects.
side_effects,What about side effects
side_effects,"The vaccine came too quickly, side effects may show in two years"
side_effects,What about the vaccine side effects
side_effects,Side effects are still unknown 
side_effects,because of side effects
side_effects,"I disagree at this point, because vaccination doesn't mean you will never get infected, plus we don't know about side effects as well. i am especially worried about my parents and elderly people"
side_effects,I think we still need more evidence that vacine doesn't have significant side effects.
side_effects,I would like to have a baby and I'm worried the vacinr will negative effect on my unborn child. 
side_effects,I'm not worried about short term effects.
side_effects,will have side effects
side_effects,side affects?
side_effects,But what are the side effects
side_effects,But how do you know? All drugs have side effects that only means we have to take more drugs for those side effects and it is just is a drug circle
side_effects,There hasn’t been enough testing and the side effects aren’t very well known 
side_effects,there could be side effects down the line though
side_effects,The vaccine had caused people I know to have side affects such as seizures
side_effects,Some of the side affects aren’t temporary though
side_effects,"Despite being tested on others, I fear for the side effects that may occur "
side_effects,I am worried about the side effects
side_effects,"Because I do not know what it is made out of, and what the side effects are"
side_effects,There are hidden side effects that will emerge
side_effects,adverse reaction
side_effects,It may have side effects though
side_effects,Has enough time passed to allow for negative side effects to show? 
side_effects,"No, because some people that have been vaccinated say that they had side effects (e.g.trembling)."
side_effects,If vaccines do work then why are there videos of people who are suffering the side effects from getting vaccinated
side_effects,The vaccine will not protect us it does not work hence why there are people who having side effects becoming paralysed and having fits and body seizures
side_effects,worried about side effects
side_effects,that no reason to ignore side effects
side_effects,I am willing to take the risk over vaccine side effects
side_effects,there are short term side ffects too??? I was worried about long term side effects but now there is no way I wil ltake it
side_effects,"Sure, but what about the side effects?"
side_effects,"Eh, would rather not have one than manage the side effects"
side_effects,Worried about the side effects
side_effects,i have two neurological conditions which mean if i have an adverse reaction i will suffer greatly 
side_effects,What about the side effects?
side_effects,but there are side effects to the vaccine
side_effects,Ok what if i accept the vaccine and in 5 years i get serious side effects
side_effects,I am scred of the side effects
side_effects,given the potential side effects I would definitely still worry!
side_effects,how about the effects of the vaccine it self 
side_effects,it may have side effects
side_effects,i would rather wait until those side effects are reduced to acceptable level
side_effects,Well I have heard from NHS professionals that doctors are divided whether it is safe to take if you are pregnant. I am not currently pregnant but I don’t want any adverse side effects if I do decide to start a family.
side_effects,"AnNHS professional told me that it effects fertility in women for up to 8 months. If this is what we know now, what further side effects could we know in 10 years?"
side_effects,Ive seen the adverse reactions of many people since having the vaccine
side_effects,"that is not true because there are very few information on the side effects of the vaccine, which is daunting because it is forcefully already given to many people and some have also died."
side_effects,"So you say, there is still no evidence of that as I have learn't of people who suffer side effect from getting the vaccine. It has also led to some death, how do you justify that to your family and loved ones? I am not sold to taking the vaccine yet sorry"
side_effects,"Not everyone experiences COVID-19 symptoms to the same degree. It's possible that some people will not have severe unpleasant side-effects, especially if they are healthy."
side_effects,Worried about side effects
side_effects,why can't i wait a year and then get it later when we know the side effects?
side_effects,I'm scared of the side effects
side_effects,Because I am worried about the side effects 
side_effects,I am worried about the potential side-effects.
side_effects,hm ok makes sense. but what about side effects from it
side_effects,what about side effects?
side_effects,I'm not at risk of serious side effects from COVID-19
side_effects,The side effects could be potentially serious
side_effects,What about the adverse side effects 
side_effects,Some people have had serious side effects 
side_effects,I’m not worried about my health at the moment. I’m washing my hands and wearing a mask. I’m doing the best I can and my family and friends are too. I’m worried if they get the vaccine there may be side effects from it
side_effects,Short term side effects could be very detrimental for some people. I am concerned how my body would react to the vaccine 
side_effects,"Sure, but what about possible side effects?"
side_effects,"Yes, but I don't want to risk having those side effects"
side_effects,Because it has stupid side affects 
side_effects,But what if in a few years serious side effects emerge?
side_effects,Side effects
side_effects,I'm unsure about potential side effects
side_effects,But some people have had bad side effects after taking the vaccine
side_effects,There could be so many side effects that we don't know about
side_effects,The possible danger from side-effects is more problematic to me than going out with friends. I can live without that as my health is more important.
side_effects,the vaccine might have some side effects
side_effects,Fair enough but what about side effects 
side_effects,But we don't know the side affects of the vaccine on future generations 
side_effects,Because we don't know the side effects of the vaccine yet 
side_effects,"the vaccines might work, and also have side effects"
side_effects,people that are already have conditions such as allergies get serious side effects from the vaccine so not everyone will get the vaccine
safety,How is this vaccine safe?
safety,vaccine havent been tested properly
safety,I am concerned about its reliability
safety,"That is true, but a vaccine that hasn't been properly tested could be more dangerous than the virus itself."
safety,but saying its safe doesnt 100% make it safe. lots of things in the past have had issues we never calculated.
safety,I don't trust it was fully and properly tested 
safety,I don’t think COVID-19 would be dangerous to me
safety,safety concerns
safety,I would rather stay at home indoors like this and be safe
safety,I don’t think it’s been tested enough. Don’t trust it 
safety,But what if the vaccine is dangerous?
safety,still concerned about efficiency of the vaccine
safety,I just don’t trust it
safety,It's hasn't been tested long enought.
safety,I am worried about its safety
safety,but what if it is unsafe
safety,it is not a safe way if the vaccine is not safe
safety,doesnt seem safe
safety,But is the vaccine safe for me? You state that it is safe without knowing any of my medical history.
safety,It hasn't been tested properly 
safety,That isn’t the same answer as before 
safety,They have been developed very quickly and not tested in the usual way.
safety,Prove to me that I will be safe with a vaccine
safety,hasn't been tested properly 
safety,"No it is not the only safe way, not everyone needs it! Therefore it is a choice."
safety,I don’t trust it
safety,"Because it’s sped up, they’re skipping the safety precautions and just rushing it out as soon as possible"
safety,Where is the evidence that says it is safe?
safety,There’s still not enough evidence to guarantee my safety if I take the vaccine
safety,I dont want to get a vaccine for something so deadly i need to be tested to see if i even have it
safety,dangerous chemical
safety,I want to wait till it has had longer testing
safety,"I do not trust that they have been adequately tested, most vaccines and treatments go through rigorous tests for years at a time before they are even considered for human use."
safety,Not enough research and the additives in the vaccine are dangerous
safety,"It still not tested enought. Usually, vaccines are getting tested for years before given to the public."
safety,There has not been enough testing performed on these vaccines.
safety,They have not been tested properly and proper research has not been done on them
safety,worried about the safety of vaccine 
safety,Because i don't think it has been tested enough.
safety,I still feel it is unsafe.
safety,I am still very concerned that the vaccine is not safe.
safety,no way a vaccine that was developed in half a year is safe
safety,I don't trust that it is safe just yet.
safety,im not sure the vaccine is safe
safety,the government lies about the safety of the vaccine 
safety,it is dangerous to human body
safety,There aren't many data that proof its safety
safety,Who will take the blame if vaccine proves to be more harmful than good
safety,I just dont think the vaccine is safe enough in longterm
safety,There are other ways to stay safe
safety,it might be dangerous
safety,I believe its unsafe
safety,i do not belive it is safe
safety,a vaccine can not be developed and tested in 7 months
safety,a safe vaccine take years to  develope and test
safety,I don’t ant it because it may not be safe yet and I don’t feel it has been tested enough. Or as much as other vaccines have. They took years To develop so why wouldn’t the others
safety,Not sure Ernst have been tested enough 
safety,exactly we dont know whether the vaccine is safe
safety,It looks that it is not properly tested
safety,I am not sure how safe it is
safety,I will consider its safety and effectiveness (how well it works) in people. It seems still not mature yet.
safety,I do not feel that it has been tested for a long enough time frame to be sure it works
safety,They don’t know that it creates hers immunity though that hasn’t been tested 
safety,I am still worried about the safety of the vaccine 
safety,but it has not been properly tested
safety,The vaccines are not safe at all
safety,"Just because it has been tested, doesnt mean that it will be safe and perfect for everyone to use. Its too early"
safety,I just don’t trust it 
safety,Because I don’t trust it 
safety,What if the vaccine is dangerous?
safety,It might be unsafe
safety,The vaccine could be dangerous
safety,I do not believe it is safe yet
safety,What if it is harmful
safety,I do not think it is deemed safe yet
safety,Hasn't been throuroughly tested
safety,"the vaccine moved way too quickly through the testing trials, so i don't think it has had long enough to become tested and safe"
safety,"No, risk is higher with low tested vac"
safety,It is only tested for 1yr
safety,I don’t think the Covid 19 vaccine has been thoroughly tested 
safety,It has had mixed reviews and is too new on the market to trust
safety,"Well, I read it hasn't been tested on pregnant women"
safety,I dont think the vaccine is safe
safety,yeah but they all didnt got enough time to test the vaccine properly 
safety,I'm not sure if it will be safe
safety,I am still not convinced about its safety
safety,I don’t trust doctors 
safety,Currently TTC and dont trust the vaccine
safety,I’m not sure whether they’re safe to have
safety,i don't want to take the COVID-19 vaccine because i believe it is not well tested.
safety,i still don't trust the vaccine developers 100%
safety,I don’t think it’s safe
safety,Is it safe for children?
safety,I will not have a unsafe vaccine in me. More control by the evil government. No .
safety,Vaccine is only safe if it's produced properly with thorough research 
safety,Because it hasn’t had enough testing 
safety,I don’t trust it 
safety,I'm being safe by staying in at the moment and letting the older generation get their vaccines now 
safety,but they were not tested for as long as vaccines are usually tested for
safety,the testing is never diverse
safety,"I still uncertain at the moment, but will take it when I am certain it is safe."
safety,this isn't a typical vaccine
safety,seems like human testing
safety,this isn't a normal vaccine
safety,i cant trust it 
high_survival_rate,This virus has a 99.9% survival rate
high_survival_rate,It is not a highly infectious deadly virus
high_survival_rate,Many many people survive from Covid and we only hear about the bad cases 
high_survival_rate,The virus has a high survival rate
high_survival_rate,Survival of the fittest
high_survival_rate,"the virus has greater than 99% survival rate, the ""vaccine"" is unnecessary"
high_survival_rate,COVID-19 has a 99% survival rate
high_survival_rate,Vaccine do bot have the 100 sussess rate.
high_survival_rate,touche. but covid has a super high survival rate
high_survival_rate,"I dont feel like i need it, covid has an aboce 95% survival rate. I would rather other people with compromised immune systems get it first"
high_survival_rate,i mean with a virus that has a 95% survival rate. we would achieved that regardless but yes this is a safer way. people getting the virus can make them immune
high_survival_rate,But is there enough evidence to prove it will not make people ill especially with most individuals having a 99.9% survivor rate when getting coronavirus?
high_survival_rate,COVID has a huge survival rate without vaccines anyway!
healthy,"I know that, but I'm in good health for my age"
healthy,I don't worry about my health anyway. I am a healthy person with a healthy lifestyle.
healthy,I am not worried about my health right now as I am healthy and I will only be effected by the virus in a small way like a cold or flu
healthy,"I really don't need it, my immune system is pretty much good"
healthy,I am not worried about my health anyway 
healthy,"I prefer my chances against Covid 19, I am young and healthy"
healthy,what about young and healthy individuals
healthy,"I don't believe that, I think that our immune system is strong and alot of the deaths that have been recorded have been people with other illnesses before Covid even appeared"
healthy,I don't.  They are all healthy. The vaccine could change that
healthy,"Not thank you, not convinced I'm not risking my health being injected. Will take my chances with covid "
healthy,"(this chatbot sucks at arguing because the responses aren't addressing what I'm saying).. Whether the vaccine works or not, I do not want to get it because I do not think it is necessary for me as a young and healthy individual to get the vaccine."
healthy,ha ha us anti vaxxers will be the only healthy ones left
healthy,I am healthy and not worried to catch COVID
healthy,I’d rather let my immune system develop naturally
healthy,"agree but the chances are very low. if all fat and sick people get vaccinated and the healthy ones dont, the percentage of dangerous cases will be very low and not overburden the healthcare system of any country"
healthy,I am young and healthy and also never get the flu vaccine
healthy,but the same is true for the flu - I am sure if you are young and healthy the chances are less likely to get long covid
healthy,I have strong immunity
healthy,That’s fair enough but for me I’m not worried about my health 
healthy,"I believe that those who cannot afford to contract the virus (e.g. immune compromised, prior health conditions, etc.) should receive it. However those with a healthy immune system should be able to choose and not have the vaccine forced upon them. Healthy people being exposed to it and building up a natural tolerance will also create herd immunity."
healthy,These people are not of age. These people are healthy and are living well. This has been due to the vaccination. Children were also mentioned in this article 
healthy,True but I am young and healthy and I don't think I will need the vaccine
healthy,There are many ways to create herd immunity. The healthy people who are not at risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms can generate antibodies naturally.
healthy,"I am not suggesting that we can assume all young and healthy people will be safe from COVID, but I could make the same argument for vaccines. There have been cases of people, both young and healthy, taking the COVID-19 vaccine and dying. And we do not know the reason for this."
healthy,It may not be totally necessary for my age group
healthy,I dont worry about my health or the health of my familyof my 
healthy,Because my body is healthy as it is
healthy,No thanks. I wont risk that in my body. I have no underlying health conditions and would rather build up my immune system
healthy,I have no underlying health conditions. Im a healthy
healthy,Yeah I understand but I’m healthy so should be fine not to have it
healthy,because they're perfectly healthy
healthy,Because I don't trust it and I do not need one since I'm healthy and young 
healthy,I do not find the virus dangerous since my immune system is strong 
healthy,My immune system is strong 
healthy,"i am not doubting that, just worried about my personal health"
healthy,im young
mutation,It might not vaccinate me against new variants.
mutation,but it is unclear how long the vaccine would protect us and whether its effective on the new variants
mutation,"That may be true but how do we know whats going to go further into the vaccine, especially if its like the flu and going to just mutate further as there are already other variants some that are more resilient to vaccines"
mutation,"Even against the new variants? For every vaccine breakthrough, there are plenty of mutations taking place that may or may not render them useless."
mutation,Then why don’t we vaccinate against all viruses
mutation,I will refuse the vaccine until there are viable studies that prove it effectively protects against all variants. It is just not effective enough right now
mutation,No as the virus will mutate and will cause another strain and outbreak
mutation,In addition we don’t know that these vaccines will cover all the variants or last longer than several months 
mutation,the new strains
mutation,But the vaccine wasn’t designed for the new strain of coronavirus  
mutation,We still have to worry about mutations 
mutation,"so we get the vaccine, and there is a new variant of the virus that does not react to the vaccines"
mutation,but there will be new variants
mutation,there have been news about a variant where the vaccine doesnt work
mutation,"What about other strains of the virus, will we not end up in a ""Common Cold"" scenario?"
mutation,even then the uk government is saying that there will need to further lockdowns and re dosing for the new variants 
mutation,are you taking the mutations to note?
mutation,i will have to worry if it mutates
mutation,We should always worry about our health. There are different variants occurring.
mutation,so this vaccine doesnt contain the virus?
mutation,"thta doesnt answer my question but ok. yea, what about mutations?"
mutation,Not with the new variant we won’t 
mutation,Unless it mutates to a variant when the vaccine won't work at all
mutation,Given all the mutations that are being found I am not sure how effective it is
mutation,But how do we know it will be effective on all the new mutations
mutation,because you havent told me about the potential inefficiency of the vaccine due to mutations
mutation,what if the virus mutates faster than the vaccine can cover it
mutation,but will it work against different variants?
mutation,are they also working to the new variant
mutation,what about the new variant 
mutation,"The flu vaccine needs to be redeveloped and administered every year to continue having an effect, as flu viruses mutate too. So yes, covid mutating would mean that the vaccine is redundant depending on what strain of the virus you have."
mutation,Technically not as there is a new variant now 
mutation,New variants mean it will still spread 
mutation,but the fact that the vaccine is only made for a certain strain of covid does not cover all the strains of covid now present in the society and different countries.
mutation,"What if we all got vaccinated and a new variant developed that was resistant, do we then keep having more vaccines "
mutation,ok. but what about all the new strains that are appearing? 
mutation,"But your argument does not consider new variants of the virus, of which there are currently 4000 or so recorded, which at any moment could evolve to a point in which current vaccines are rendered ineffective as a single variant could bypass the immune system"
mutation,But there has been a variant recently discovered in samples which could potentially bypass the immune system entirely rendering vaccines useless
mutation,What about the constantly changing variants
mutation,What about the South African strain
mutation,"not really, since the virus can evolve and mutate so theoretically i could still get a strain of the virus even after taking the vaccine"
mutation,"Until another variant arrives, then we’ll all be told we need another vaccine!!"
mutation,I may have to worry as people react differently both to the virus and the vaccine
mutation,But we do not have a vaccine for all strains of the virus
mutation,but one day it might mutate too much
fertility,"I don’t want to take it as I believe it’s been rushed, I feel weary of a vaccine that’s been created in 8 months. I am also a young female and I would like to have children in the near future, I do not want my fertility to be affected"
fertility,I will have to worry as it affects fertility 
fertility,I dont think its the right choice for me. I dont know what the compications may be onece i have children. 
fertility,Still not worth hurting my child over 
fertility,"No, is it said that the vaccine makes females to not be able to give birth in the future."
fertility,"I am also looking into getting pregnant by the end of this year, not definite yet, but thinking about it"
fertility,"Heard it may have implications for fertility, not planning on starting a family soon but will do in the future "
fertility,not so sure if you can call it safe if it can cause all sorts of long term side effects like infertility
fertility,id rather recover from long covid than sacrifice my fertility
fertility,because how can you not know whether it can affect fertility?
fertility,Because there’s not enough data on how it will affect fertility 
fertility,Having children is important to me
fertility,I've heard it can affects female fertility
fertility,"I would worry because, like I mentioned before, we don't know the long term effects. Eg. How it will affect fertility - women looking to get pregnant in the future"
fertility,There is not enough research on whether it affects fertility 
fertility,yes but if it affects fertility how will more people create families?
fertility,will it cause infertility
fertility,what if it causes birth deffects
already_had,maybe I already had covid
already_had,I’ve already contracted covid and developed immunity to it.
already_had,I have already had coronavirus so why would I get a jab protecting me from it 
already_had,I’ve had Covid already and didn’t have any symptoms
already_had,I had Covid already
already_had,I've already had COVID and therefore already have the antibodies
already_had,I think i have already had it in the summer
already_had,"maybe we should stop playing with ""agent orange"" and go back to church already."
already_had,ive already had covid to i need immunisation
already_had,i had covid
already_had,I had covid already. The vaccine worries me   more than getting it again
injecting_unknown_substance,Because I am only 19 and don’t want to be something in my body that I don’t have to 
injecting_unknown_substance,That's is just your opinion. Injecting foreign substance into my body without full knowledge of what could happen is much scarier to me.
injecting_unknown_substance,I would rather take the risk with my own immune system than take a risk with the foreign bodies from a vaccine
injecting_unknown_substance,Dont yryst any vaccines at all mosy contain toxic ingredients
injecting_unknown_substance,It is important. People shouldn't be pushed into something if they are not comfortable with it. It is important to know ALL and EVERY detail about vaccine you put into your body
injecting_unknown_substance,"Covid is around 99.6. % recoverable, why risk toxins in your body for a virus that is so low risk"
injecting_unknown_substance,I will still worry about my health if I inject something I am not sure it is safe into my body
injecting_unknown_substance,I don’t like putting things in my body 
injecting_unknown_substance,"Don't care! Will not put poison in my body, it has been over a year and I think I have already had it "
injecting_unknown_substance,because I am sceptical about the vaccine ingredients
injecting_unknown_substance,I just simply don't want to injection something into my body if I don’t believe in it
injecting_unknown_substance,i dont trust the ingredient that are used to make the vaccine 
injecting_unknown_substance,because it is essentially injecting the virus into your body
injecting_unknown_substance,i don't want the government to control me with technology injected into my body. my body is a temple. 
injecting_unknown_substance,But do you realise whats actually inside it?
injecting_unknown_substance,Yes I understand but I don't want to put something in my body which I don't trust 
injecting_unknown_substance,The vacine is extremely new and could have anything inside of it
injecting_unknown_substance,Because I don't like needles and I am wary of putting things into my body that are unknown
natural_herd_immunity,Vaccines are not needed to achieve herd immunity.
natural_herd_immunity,Allowing the virus to spread without a vaccine would also create herd immunity.
natural_herd_immunity,We can achieve herd immunity through our own bodies defence 
natural_herd_immunity,just catch it to get heard immunity?
natural_herd_immunity,"No, the virus would achieve herd immunity of its own accord"
natural_herd_immunity,This is false. A vaccine is not the only way to create herd immunity. The development of herd immunity is a biological phenomenon that occurs without pharmacological intervention.
natural_herd_immunity,You do not need a vaccine to achieve herd immunity.
natural_herd_immunity,We could also get herd immunity by not taking the vaccine and letting are own immune systems work as they should.
natural_herd_immunity,Herd immunity happens naturally.
natural_herd_immunity,Herd immunity can be achieved without the vaccine
natural_herd_immunity,I believe that herd immunity can be achieved without myself getting the vaccine and the potential negative risks that come along with it.
natural_herd_immunity,We can also create herd immunity by catching COVID and let our bodies fight it naturally
natural_herd_immunity,we can gain herd immunity from catching the virus normally
natural_herd_immunity,we can also just all get the virus and get it over with finally and create herd immunity this way
flu,"I never get the flu jab, so I don't feel I need a Covid Vaccine either."
flu,i only take the necessary vaccines. I also never take the flu shot
flu,I’m happy to do that anyway. Flu kills thousands every year and we don’t do anything about it
flu,They say that about flu but I don’t get the flu jab either so why would I get the Covid vaccine
flu,I am scared of needles and only take vaccines that I believe are absolutely necessary. I never got the flu shot and I doubt I will take this one
flu,"The last time I had a flu vaccine, I woke up in the middle of the night with a panic attack "
flu,Fair enough but I have never had the flu jab 
long_term_effects,It is new so long term side effects are unavailable.
long_term_effects,"As it's a new vaccine, the potential long-term side effects are not known."
long_term_effects,I don't know exactly the long term effect on the people body's
long_term_effects,Not sure of the long term risks
long_term_effects,Not enough research for the long term side effects
long_term_effects,im 28 years old it will take long time i dont know what they do 
long_term_effects,Long term effects have not been possible to test.
long_term_effects,"It's not made like other vaccines before it, so really don't know what the (long-term) effects are, just on that point."
long_term_effects,It hasnt been tested for long term effects
long_term_effects,no long term studies to show the effects 
long_term_effects,I don't want to stand in those long lines waiting.
long_term_effects,because it was rushed through and we dont know the long term side effects.
long_term_effects,I have already had covid once.  Why risk putting something in my body that I do not know the long term effects of in 20 years? No thanks.
long_term_effects,It has not been available for long enough to know the long term effects of the vaccine.
long_term_effects,I dont think I am at high risk of any long term effects
long_term_effects,Long term side effects are unknown.
long_term_effects,I believe the covid-19 vaccine does not stop the spreading and it's said that it will not maintain immunity in a person for very long. So it means I would need to take fairly unconventional vaccines regularly without knowing the long term side effects.
long_term_effects,I want to wait for check if there is a danger in long term after vaccine
long_term_effects,Long-term negative effects are unknown
long_term_effects,"It hasnt been a vaccine or virus that has been around long enough to know if its 100% safe, I have 2 children and so feel i cant risk it"
long_term_effects,I dont know the long term effects
long_term_effects,Concerned about any long term side effects
long_term_effects,I'm going to wait at least a year to see the long term effects (if there are any) on people.
long_term_effects,I think there are very few vaccines with actual long term data that rules out cancer.
side_effects,There's an alarming amount of footage of people suffering from severe side-effects.
side_effects,Unsure of the side effects
side_effects,The side effects of COVID-19 vaccination are unknown.
side_effects,I am afraid of possible side effects in the coming years
side_effects,Side effects from the vaccine Possible death 
side_effects,possible side-effects (e.g. not know input on future pregnancy )
side_effects,after effects
side_effects,"
It is not 100% safe, there are already cases of people with secondary problems or death."
side_effects,Im afraid of side  effects
side_effects,Would like the side effects to be more clear.
side_effects,I am worried about negative reaction.
side_effects,i feel that it might have side effects
side_effects,I am afraid of side effects
side_effects,"Too new, we don't know if there are side effects"
side_effects,Drugs have nasty side effects
side_effects,Side effects
side_effects,risk of adverse effects
side_effects,"My primary reason for not getting a vaccine, this type of vaccine was not thoroughly tested for a prolonged time.  Tests were hastily done to put out a vaccine and these companies did not think of the side effects that can occur in days to come."
side_effects,Worried about short term Side effects 
side_effects,Im not sure about side effects
side_effects,I don't know the side effects yet.
side_effects,Don't want to suffer from secondary effects.
side_effects,I want to wait to see what effect it has on others before I put it on.
side_effects,Afraid of undiscovered side effects
side_effects,People already have got side effects.
side_effects,I understand there may be side effects from the vaccine.
side_effects,possible side effects in the future that we dont know about yet
side_effects,I am not sure about the possible side effects
side_effects,Very uncomfortable with the use of mRNA in vaccines and its side effect
side_effects,Not sure about the lasting side effects.
side_effects,There isn't enough data about the effect on baby
side_effects,"Vaccines have side effects, i want to protect my body."
side_effects,"the first vaccines are a test, many people will have negative effects and from there better vaccines will come out
"
side_effects,"once the vaccine has proven to be harmless in terms of side effects, i'm fine with i.t"
side_effects,"Its too new, lots of people reporting side effects but it doesnt reach the media - check the adverse reactions logs "
side_effects,side effects
side_effects,some people have severe side effects after vaccination which is worrying 
safety,"I question the safety, and necessity, of the vaccine. "
safety,It is not well tested.
safety,"i have M.E and the effects of this vaccine with this particular complex condition have yet to be truly known. I'm pro vaccine, but am personally gonna wait a bit longer than most til i know it is safe for people with my particular condition."
safety,too new to trust the efficacy of the vaccine 
safety,"Lots of people say that the vaccine is not well tested and people are being treated as guinea pigs. I rather disagree, but frankly, I'm not sure what to think."
safety,It is not safe
safety,I want it to be tested more and on a longer term.
safety,I dont trust it 
safety,Just want to make sure its safe
safety,I don't trust the vaccine.
safety,I am unsure if the vaccines have been properly tested and are safe and efficient. 
safety,Its not field tested enough
safety,it's dangerous
safety,"I was already once infected with covid, but not diagnosed. Likely Im' going to do antigen test test to confirm my suspicions"
safety,Do not believe that the vaccine has been fully tested on human and all the side effects isn't known.
safety,I still have concerns about safety after such a short production and testing time and need more reassurance and evidence of this.
safety,I do not trust vaccines!
safety,I don't trust their safety.
safety,I am not confident that it has been tested properly.
safety,I don't trust the vaccine.

fast_development,they made the vaccine very quick
fast_development,It was produced too quickly.
fast_development,Seems abit rushed out
fast_development,"There was a lot of pressure to get these vaccines made and approved as quickly as possible, so I'm not completely sure about the evaluation of secondary effects"
fast_development,A good vaccine usualy takes about 10 years to develop. These covid-19 vaccines came up after a year of development. I do not trust the security of it.
fast_development,"For clarifications, I am not against taking it, I'm just undecided at the moment. 


The rushed process makes me feel uneasy. I don't pretend to know anything at all about vaccines but it has been said to me that it takes years for vaccines to be finalized and approved under normal circumstances. More specifically, I would like to hear some assurances regarding the long-term effects ideally made by a trusted source. Even with a thorough internet search I could not find anything published by an organization not involved in the development/distribution process excluding those associated with the government. If I don't know what happens to those who have been tested with the vaccine in 4 years, I don't know what will happen to me in 4 years after allowing the vaccine inside my body."
fast_development,I do not want to get a COVID-19 vaccine because I feel that it was still in the trial phase and it was rushed.
fast_development,It's not that I definitely don't want one but given how quickly they've been rolled out I'd be concerned if they are actually effective.
fast_development,I don't trust a rushed vaccine.
fast_development,"Vaccine trials and production were rushed very quickly, and possible side effects may not be seen in the short term."
fast_development,development was rushed
fast_development,Rushed research into the vaccine
fast_development,"Too little  experiments, too fast to get the vaccine instead to do more trail and wait longer  "
fast_development,"I don't trust a vaccine made in such a short time. Even with the many resources given, you can't just throw money at something to get it done, some things need time."
fast_development,"The vaccines were developed through a rush process. There are 3 of them and we don't really know what's better, what's not. It's being pushed either way. Whether it's one dose or two dose. "
fast_development,I have some concerns about possible side effects too with such a new vaccine that has been rushed through. Therefore in some respects I would sooner not get it too quickly as you have longer to evaluate impact of the vaccine if any in a negative way.
fast_development,This vaccine was invented a little quickly and I'm a bit worried for now.
fast_development,I don't trust this new vaccine because it was developed too quickly.
fast_development,I feel that the process and roll out has been rushed.
fast_development,The vaccination was created incredibly quickly.  Usually vaccinations are in the making for years before they are rolled out to the public.
fast_development,its been rushed through
healthy,I am young and I don't feel like getting a vaccine
healthy,I am young and very healthy.
healthy,I am healthy and 34 years old. So even if get infected the chances that I will need to go to a hospital are very few.
healthy,II am a young and healthy person
healthy,I don't consider it necessary since covid is just a strain of flu and I have good immune system. 
healthy,It alters your DNA/immune system.
healthy,I am young and probably there won't be serious consequences if I get sick from covid-19.
healthy,"I don't need it as I believe I am healthy, and capable of fighting it myself."
healthy,Im in good health whole year
healthy,"I'm young, healthy and exercise regularly, there aren't many chances of me getting serious symptoms if I get covid."
healthy,Good luck with your pointless propaganda and FUCK. YOU.
mutation,Too much mutations of this virus 
mutation,vaccines unlikely helps for new variant of covid virus according to some uk scientists 
mutation,"The virus mutates and so any vaccine is only temporarily effective. Seems like a waste of resources and effort to get a shot that will only last a few months. Again, I feel the same way about the flu vaccine."
mutation,"The virus can keep mutating, rendering the vaccine ineffective."
mutation,"I don't like it's being pushed so heavily on people when it's very hard to trust information about it when there's such a strong profit motive and politics behind it. They're downplaying reactions people have gotten as ""rare"" or ""unrelated."" And there's mixed messages--right now, a week ago we were told it'll protect against all variants of coronavirus...now I'm reading that everyone needs to take it soon or it won't work on variants that are being discovered. Also, some people get the virus anyway...it's claimed that it takes 7 days for the vaccine to start protecting a person.  "
mutation,Doubt that it will even work against all the new strains and variants that are coming out.
flu,"I don't think COVID-19 is serious enough for me to go out of my way to get a vaccine. For example, I get my Tetanus shots but I've never gotten shots for the seasonal flu because I can deal with that if I do get sick."
flu,"I don't get vaccines for illnesses that are very unlikely to kill or disfigured me. For things like the corona virus and the flu, I'd rather get sick and recover with natural immunity. Immune systems need to get exercise in order to stay strong."
flu,I never get a flu vaccine because the one time I did I got the flu
flu,"i do not get flu jab yearly, why should i get this one"
flu,I have never even got a flu shot so I'm definitely not getting this vaccine. 
flu,covid19 is a coronavirus which is a stronger version of the common cold which is a coronavirus. if you cant cure the common cold or all flu then how can you cure a disease which is along the similar lines and has been around a shorter time
flu,HAVE NOT TAKEN FLU SHOT FOR 10 YEAR AND HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE FLU. IF THIS VACCINE BECOMES A YEARLY SHOT I AM VERY UNLIKELY TO GET IT EVERY YEAR.  
flu,Regular flu has a higher death rate than COVID-19.
flu,ive had covid19 and it was weaker than any flu i have had.

Great, thanks. Don't forget, you can always end the chat by typing 'quit'. 
 
So tell me, why would you not consider getting a COVID-19 vaccine, should one be developed?

User
By the time it gets developed, it will not be effective

Covidvaccbot
Lockdowns are crippling to the economy, as well as your mental health and well-being. Getting a vaccine will make you feel safe when you go to crowded places and allow you to return to your normal life.

User
Wearing face masks and social distancing makes me feel safe

Covidvaccbot
A vaccine will protect you from getting sick and reduce the risk of getting COVID-19 and avoid potentially fatal complications that COVID-19 can cause

User
Being reasonable and making adjustment could prevent , reduce risks too

Covidvaccbot
Vaccines are well researched before releasing, they need to go through multiple stages of trails. Risk of COVID is higher than the risk of side effects

User
It takes a lot of time, virus will eventually mutate and vaccine will not protect people from the new version

Covidvaccbot
It is unknown if COVID-19 mutates to a degree that renders a vaccine useless. If we find a vaccine and the virus mutates it will be easier to work out that mutation and work on the vaccine to match it and counter it

User
Research will cost a lot therefore the vaccine will be expensive and you might need more than one

Covidvaccbot
The cost to treat a virus such a Covid will be significantly higher than that cost to produce a vaccine. The overall cost in medical care, education and to the economy is far greater than the cost to buy a vaccine that will prevent any further preventable cost

User
The cost of unnecessary vaccines and their complications could be fatal

Covidvaccbot
Costs could be cut as production is made more efficient. Government subsidies can remove the cost from the public directly

User
There will be an indirect cost, citizens might not need to pay for the vaccine but govermenta might hide the costs somewhere else, eg additonal taxes

Covidvaccbot
The cost of vaccination can be offset against the benefits to the economy of having more people healthy and working, and the lessened impact on the health service.

User
Working from home is cost effective as well, less interaction and less chance to spread the virus

Covidvaccbot
Money should not factor in an option where you could potentially save lives. "

User
Potentially is the key word, it is not proven yet

Covidvaccbot
No company or government would allow a product onto the market without being extremely confident that the side effects would be minimal or non existent.

User
I agree. In the meantime people carry on with their lives and adjust to the new norms, no need for vaccine

Covidvaccbot
Getting a vaccine will protect not just you but also reduce the risk of you spreading the disease and potentially infecting vulnerable people.

User
Covid is a virus, a flu. Many people do not get flu jab

Covidvaccbot
A vaccine is the only save way to create herd immunity which is necessary to stop the virus spreading. This will protect us all from getting the virus, as well as those who, for some reason, cannot get the vaccine (e.g. allergy)

User
Side effects could cause more deaths than a virus

Covidvaccbot
There is no evidence to show that sufficient testing will not be carried out

User
It cannot be tested for all possible options

Covidvaccbot
The Government would not allow drugs onto the market if they hadn't been sufficiently tested"

User
Goverment eased the lockdown before the option to get vaccinated, the number of deaths did not increase significantally

Covidvaccbot
with any medicine there can be severe side effects but these only occur in a small amount of cases.  The benefits of a vaccine far outweighs the risk

User
It will be still riskier than having a flu

Covidvaccbot
I ran out of arguments ðŸ™‚

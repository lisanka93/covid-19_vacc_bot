Great, thanks. Don't forget, you can always end the chat by typing 'quit'. 
 
So tell me, why would you not consider getting a COVID-19 vaccine, should one be developed?

User
I think it's not safe at the beginning.

Lockdowns are crippling to the economy, as well as your mental health and well-being. Getting a vaccine will make you feel safe when you go to crowded places and allow you to return to your normal life.

User
Only if it's safe. I would wait a year to see if there are any side effects.

Covidvaccbot
Vaccines are well researched before releasing, they need to go through multiple stages of trails. Risk of COVID is higher than the risk of side effects

User
They can't test vaccines on every person. Every organism is different.

Covidvaccbot
There have been no outbreaks of such a virus of this scale in recent times (i.e. the last 100 years) so there is no proven system to deal with this that works with so many varying factors.  The government have done the best they can with all things being considered.

User
I don't think so. The reaction was late.

Covidvaccbot
A vaccine will protect you from getting sick and reduce the risk of getting COVID-19 and avoid potentially fatal complications that COVID-19 can cause

User
I'm not in a risk group, so I don't want any vaccines.

Covidvaccbot
No company or government would allow a product onto the market without being extremely confident that the side effects would be minimal or non existent.

User
There's too much pressure to make medicines, so something could go wrong.

Covidvaccbot
Getting a vaccine will protect not just you but also reduce the risk of you spreading the disease and potentially infecting vulnerable people.

User
I respect every government reccomendations, so it's extremely low risk of infection caused by me.

Covidvaccbot
Poor decisions have been made, particularly following the Dominic Cummings situation. The government are not developing a vaccine - scientists are. Yes, they are guided/funded by government but they are doctors/scientists bound by a responsibility to do right. We must have some trust otherwise the world would just stop.

User
It wouldn't stop. We can live with respecting rules and recommendations, so viruses wouldn't spread too fast. It will be possible to counterattack.

Covidvaccbot
There is no evidence to show that sufficient testing will not be carried out

User
But it's still a chance that somebody could make a mistake.

Covidvaccbot
A vaccine is the only save way to create herd immunity which is necessary to stop the virus spreading. This will protect us all from getting the virus, as well as those who, for some reason, cannot get the vaccine (e.g. allergy)

User
Healthy people could defeat the virus on their own, so we don't need to vaccine everyone.

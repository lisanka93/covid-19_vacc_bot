Great, thanks. Don't forget, you can always end the chat by typing 'quit'. 
 
So tell me, why would you not consider getting a COVID-19 vaccine, should one be developed?


User
Not enough research could possibly have been done in such a short time to prove validity or safety

Covidvaccbot
Lockdowns are crippling to the economy, as well as your mental health and well-being. Getting a vaccine will make you feel safe when you go to crowded places and allow you to return to your normal life.

User
It will not make me feel any safer,because there is not enough evidence to prove safety or continuity of the vaccine

Covidvaccbot
The Government would not allow drugs onto the market if they hadn't been sufficiently tested"

User
That is not true, I believe that covid has caused immense panic and the government will put an unproven vaccine out to appease the public and finances

Covidvaccbot
There have been no outbreaks of such a virus of this scale in recent times (i.e. the last 100 years) so there is no proven system to deal with this that works with so many varying factors.  The government have done the best they can with all things being considered.

User
No the have not, they have not been truly honest with the death rates or infection rates, and were inconsistent with responses to the crisis, I didn't feel this has been handled that well

Covidvaccbot
Poor decisions have been made, particularly following the Dominic Cummings situation. The government are not developing a vaccine - scientists are. Yes, they are guided/funded by government but they are doctors/scientists bound by a responsibility to do right. We must have some trust otherwise the world would just stop.

User
True scientists would never put out a vaccine in such a short time and without thorough testing and there hasn't been enough time for this

Covidvaccbot
Just because the vaccine has been developed quickly it doesnâ€™t mean it is any less safe than one that has taken longer to be developed. However lots of treatments come with possible side effects, It's about weighing the the possible side effects against the effects of getting COVID

User
Yes it is, but which side are the the odds for , I don't believe that has been proved yet

Covidvaccbot
Vaccines are well researched before releasing, they need to go through multiple stages of trails. Risk of COVID is higher than the risk of side effects

User
Is it,  is there proof of this, is has been an once in a life time virus, with nothing to compared to to, so how can you know where the higher risks lie

Covidvaccbot
No company or government would allow a product onto the market without being extremely confident that the side effects would be minimal or non existent.

User
All I have to say is thalidomide,  promises were made ,tests done , horiffice longterm outcome

Covidvaccbot
The vaccine's development and release will be informed by scientists and decisions will not be made by the government without firm scientific evidence on this matter. The lock down was a more subjective policy.

User
True, but the scientific community is being forced to forge ahead regardless, and a panic vaccine is not a safe vaccine

Covidvaccbot
There is no evidence to show that sufficient testing will not be carried out

User
There us no proof to say that there will, proof takes time, and the world wont wait

Covidvaccbot
A vaccine will protect you from getting sick and reduce the risk of getting COVID-19 and avoid potentially fatal complications that COVID-19 can cause

User
Are u sure, it takes years for the Fda etc to ok a vaccine and were are not even a year into this yet, that is not enough time to prove safety

Covidvaccbot
Funding and research priority is currently directed at developing COVID-19 vaccines around the world. As a result, the process is being sped up, allowing for more clinical tests to take place in a shorter period of time

User
Spend begets mistakes , mistakes begets deaths or side effects ,I think people would rather socially distance than potentially be poisoned

Covidvaccbot
with any medicine there can be severe side effects but these only occur in a small amount of cases.  The benefits of a vaccine far outweighs the risk

User
Tell that to the family that loses someone from those side effects or have to live with life altering abnormalities as a result

Covidvaccbot
There is high scrutiny over the research on those particular vaccines and nobody would allow it to give it to public if it is unsafe. High number of places independently developing vaccines in different parts of the world makes the outcome of trials much more trustworthy on different populations

User
But that's that thing this is affecting all ethnicities differently so how can you make safe that a vaccine is safe for all colours and creeds

Covidvaccbot
Getting a vaccine will protect not just you but also reduce the risk of you spreading the disease and potentially infecting vulnerable people.

User
I am a vulnerable person and it is us how would never risk such a new vaccine,  we are all inflicted differently so.it can never be 1 shot fits all

Covidvaccbot
A vaccine is the only save way to create herd immunity which is necessary to stop the virus spreading. This will protect us all from getting the virus, as well as those who, for some reason, cannot get the vaccine (e.g. allergy)

User
How about letting nature take its course and becoming naturally immune, with good proven medical intervention that is so far proven to keep us alive

Covidvaccbot
I ran out of arguments ðŸ™‚

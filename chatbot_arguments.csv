Cost_1,"  The cost to treat a virus such a COVID will be significantly higher than that cost to produce a vaccine. The overall cost in medical care, education, and the economy is far greater than the cost to buy a vaccine that will prevent any further preventable cost",cost
Cost_2,  Costs could be cut as production is made more efficient. Government subsidies can remove the cost from the public directly,cost
Cost_3,"  Money should not factor in an option where you could potentially save lives. """,cost
Cost_4,"  Usually, vaccines for major illnesses that caused pandemic and millions of deaths in the past, are obligatory and for free (or heavily subsidised like the flu jab)",cost
Testing_3,"  Funding and research priority are currently directed at developing COVID-19 vaccines around the world. As a result, the process is being sped up, allowing for more clinical tests to take place in a shorter period of time",testing
Testing_2,"  Just because the vaccine has been developed quickly it doesn't mean it is any less safe than one that has taken longer to be developed. However lots of treatments come with possible side effects, It's about weighing the possible side effects against the effects of getting COVID",testing
Side_effects_5,  There is high scrutiny over the research on those particular vaccines and nobody would allow it to give it to the public if it is unsafe. A high number of places independently developing vaccines in different parts of the world makes the outcome of trials much more trustworthy on different populations,side_effects
Side_effects_4,"  with any medicine, there can be severe side effects but these only occur in a small number of cases. The benefits of a vaccine far outweigh the risk",side_effects
Side_effects_1,"  Vaccines are well researched before releasing, they need to go through multiple stages of trials. Risk of COVID is higher than the risk of side effects",side_effects
Side_effects_2,  No company or government would allow a product onto the market without being extremely confident that the side effects would be minimal or non-existent. ,side_effects
Mutation_1,  It is unknown if COVID-19 mutates to a degree that renders a vaccine useless. If we find a vaccine and the virus mutates it will be easier to work out that mutation and work on the vaccine to match it and counter it,mutation
Mutation_2,"  This is the worst-case scenario, there is no evidence at present that this won't happen",mutation
Mutation_3,"  So far, the virus has proven to be very stable. Even if it wasn't, like the winter flu virus which mutates, once the fundamentals of the virus have been understood it would be possible to modify the vaccine as the virus mutates. ",mutation
Mutation_4,  It might mutate but this will happen over a period of time which will allow further research and development into the disease and cures. ,mutation
Long_term_effects_1,"  True there is no time to observe long term effects, but we have a lot of experience in vaccine development. And the small risks of potential long term health effects are worth it compared to the acute risk of the virus",long_term_effects
Long_term_effects_2,  This is a fair point to make but Covid-19 has the potential to bring the world to a standstill. Something has to be done to enable people to feel safe. Science is advanced. Thorough testing would be done beforehand.,long_term_effects
Long_term_effects_3,  A vaccine will only be released if it is deemed safe. Catching COVID could mean death for some,long_term_effects
Government_trust_2,"  Poor decisions have been made. The government is not developing a vaccine - scientists are. Yes, they are guided/funded by the government but they are doctors/scientists bound by a responsibility to do right. We must have some trust otherwise the world would just stop.",government_trust
Government_trust_3,  The vaccine's development and release will be informed by scientists and decisions will not be made by the government without firm scientific evidence on this matter. The lockdown was a more subjective policy.,government_trust
Government_trust_1,  There have been no outbreaks of such a virus of this scale in recent times (i.e. the last 100 years) so there is no proven system to deal with this that works with so many varying factors. The government has done the best they can with all things being considered.,government_trust
Government_eco_2,"  the government will be keen to get a vaccine released as soon as possible, but they would not release a vaccine that they didn't think was safe and effective. It would be counter-productive and lead to long term mistrust and a much longer road to recovery",government_eco
Government_eco_1,  The backlash from the unstudied vaccine could crush the economy more. They could not take this chance.,government_eco
Government_tax_1,"  The cost of vaccination can be offset against the benefits to the economy of having more people healthy and working, and the lessened impact on the health service.",government_tax
Government_tax_2,  Research and development costs that go into the creation of a new vaccine are extremely high and the cost can be shared by a small increase in taxes which will save lives. ,government_tax
Government_tax_3,"  We have all benefited from various government measures during the pandemic which inevitably leads to increased taxes. Human suffering has already been at a high level - not just through the illness but through anxiety surrounding the illness, worrying for others, and being unable to care for loved ones. Longer-term considerations are key.",government_tax
Government_tax_4,"  Developing a vaccine is the only way things can get back to normal. More suffering will be caused by job losses and isolation etc, continuing as we are.",government_tax
Default_4,"  a vaccine is the only safe way to create herd immunity which is necessary to stop the virus spreading. This will protect us all from getting the virus, as well as those who, for some reason, cannot get the vaccine (e.g. allergy to the vaccine)",default
Default_1,"  lockdowns are crippling to the economy, as well as your mental health and well-being. Getting a vaccine will make you feel safe when you go to crowded places and allow you to return to your normal life. ",default
Default_2,  a vaccine will protect you from getting sick and reduce the risk of getting COVID-19 and avoid potentially fatal complications that COVID-19 can cause,default
Default_3,  getting a vaccine will protect not just you but also reduce the risk of you spreading the disease and potentially infecting vulnerable people.,default
Health_1,"  There have been cases of people, both young and healthy, contracting and consequently dying from covid-19 and we do not know for definite the reasons for this. Therefore we cannot say that just because someone is young and healthy covid-19 poses no threat.",healthy
Health_2,"  It is not about protecting the people that are the most well and healthy in society, it is about protecting those elderly and vulnerable. They may catch the disease and not be able to fight it off or half as good as someone healthy. ",healthy
Health_3,"  Whilst it's true that young people are less likely to die, there's increasing evidence that Covid causes long term effects - eg neurological changes - even in the previously fit and healthy individuals affected by it.",healthy
Alternative_protection_1,"  We cannot maintain social distancing and other restrictions forever. Eventually, we all want to go back to the gym, theatre, and restaurants without having to wait in massive queues due to limited spaces and having to wear face masks",alternative_protection
Alternative_protection_2,  You cannot always maintain a safe distance to someone and you might get less cautious over time. Getting a vaccine is easier and saver.,alternative_protection
Natural_HI_1,"  Herd immunity without a vaccine is by definition not a preventative measure. If 70 percent of your population is infected with a disease, it is not prevention. If only young people are immune, you'd have clusters of older people with no immunity at all, making it incredibly risky for anyone over a certain age to leave their house lest they get infected, forever.",natural_hi
Natural_HI_2,"  Tracking ""natural herd immunity"" is very hard, if not impossible, given that many people who have COVID do not show any symptoms. We will never know when herd immunity will be reached (if at all) unless we test every single person in the country. Tracking a vaccine is way easier and therefore guarantees herd immunity.",natural_hi

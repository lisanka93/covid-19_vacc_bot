User: because of side effects
CB: short_term_1
User: exactly, this vaccine was very short development
CB: default_1
User: probably that's what will happen. Lot's of people will vaccine just because they need to travel for work
CB: default_2
User: Yes I have considered it, maybe you are right
CB: default_3
User: I disagree at this point, because vaccination doesn't mean you will never get infected, plus we don't know about side effects as well. i am especially worried about my parents and elderly people
CB: short_term_2
